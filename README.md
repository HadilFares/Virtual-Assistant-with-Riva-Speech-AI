# Virtual-Assistant-with-Riva-Speech-AI
I build a virtual assistant application that integrates ASR, TTS, and NLP services to answer questions about EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa).  My virtual assistant should be able to answer an audio question about EMEA and respond in speech with the answer to the question!

In summary, i do:

- Launch Riva ASR, TTS, and NLP (includes QA) services
- Customize the virtual assistant transcriber to recognize "EMEA"
- Build a simple dialog manager (DM) with extractive QA from external documents about EMEA
- Customize the virtual assistant pronunciation of "EMEA"
- Run the virtual assistant end-to-end for a complete conversational AI dialog
